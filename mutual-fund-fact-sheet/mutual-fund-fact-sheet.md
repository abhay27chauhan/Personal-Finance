## Example

### Fund Fact Sheet of Equity small cap fund

1. Investment objectives: small Cap generates capital appreciation from a diversified portfolio of equity & equity-related securities by investing predominantly in the small market capitalisation companies across sectors

From this, we can infer –

1. The fund manager intends to have a diversified portfolio; therefore it is not focused on a specific sector
2. Investments are in Equity and equity-related securities. This is mainly stocks.
3. Investments are predominantly in the small market capitalisation companies, which means as the fund name suggests, they look at investments in the small-cap company


4. Benchmark: A mutual fund scheme should essentially benchmark itself to an index. This is required to evaluate the performance of the fund over a period. A mutual fund should have the appropriate benchmark. For example, a small-cap fund is benchmarked against a small-cap index, as in this case. It is almost mis-spelling if the benchmark is not appropriate, for example, a small-cap fund being benchmarked against a large-cap index

5. Type of scheme:

Type in the given pic -> The type is– Open-ended, equity, growth scheme

```
1. close-ended -> has a specified ending period. 

For example, I can start a fund today and let it run for three years from today, at the end of 3rd year, the fund will cease to exist, and the investor is obligated to collect his money back (along with the profit or losses). Funds with such defined time are called a ‘closes ended fund’.

2. open-ended ->  If a fund does not have an expiry date, then it’s called an open-ended fund. For all practical purposes, its always good to deal with an open-ended fund

3. Equity – This is a reference to the asset class the mutual fund invests
```

4. Fund Manager: Always do a quick google search to know his background and his past performance.

5. Allotment date: The allotment date gives you a sense of how old the fund is.

6. Plans and Options: 

```
Plans -> 

1. Regular Plan - Not good. has a middle man. There is nothing wrong with this, except that the money is going from your pocket.

2. Direct Plan - Now you don’t need to buy the fund via a distributor. If you know which fund to buy, capable of doing your mutual fund research (which by the way is the end objective of this module), then you can buy that fund directly from the AMC. When you buy directly from the AMC, then there is no distributor involved; hence the distributor commissions are not paid, which means you save on commissions, which naturally means a better return on your investment.

when you buy mutual funds via Zerodha, you are buying a direct plan

Options ->

when the fund manager buys the stock of a company, and the company issues a dividend, then the AMC receives this divided. Since the funds with the AMC belongs to the investors, this dividend belongs to the investors. The dividend you are entitled to obtain from the AMC is to the extent you’ve invested in the fund. The AMC gives you two options – you can withdraw this dividend, or you can choose to reinvest the dividend amount and buy more units of the fund.

1. dividend payout - option helps you withdraw the dividend as and when the dividend gets paid.

2. Dividend reinvestment plan – This plan receives the dividend on your behalf and reinvests the dividend into the same fund. So necessarily, you don’t get the dividend in the form of cash, but instead more units or NAV of the same fund.

3. Growth plan – This one is best one. In the growth plan, the investor does not receive any dividends. The profits earned are ploughed back to fund and therefore the ‘compounding effect’, works well here.

```

7. SIP: systematic investment plan - this section tells about minimum requirements to start an SIP. In the given pic, the AMC has specified that the minimum SIP amount every month is Rs.1000/- and the minimum number of months is six.

8. initial minimum investment: self explainatory

9. Load Structure: the amount of money, in percentage terms; you will have to pay in case you wish to withdraw from the fund.

there are two types of load structure – 

```
1. Entry load - This is no longer applicable.

2. Exit load - This is the amount of money you will have to pay at the time of withdrawal. As you can see, there is a 1% load if you wish to withdraw before the completion of 1 year and no-load post that.
```
