Primarily, there are five different categories of mutual funds under which there are many different categories

1. Equity
2. Debt
3. Hybrid
4. Solution-oriented
5. Other schemes

Important points to keep in mind while investing in equity-scheme:

1. Equity oriented mutual funds are not a solution for short term financial goals. recommended invest time - at least ten plus years.
2. The market is volatile; this is the very nature of this beast. However, the only way for a common man to deal with volatility is to give your investment sufficient time. Hence, a short term approach to MF investing does not work.
3. don't keep switching b/w mutual funds
4. Headline investing â€“ Most investors get carried away by newspaper headlines. A headline which remotely hints at â€˜bearishnessâ€™, is taken way too seriously and used as a reason to exit an ongoing mutual fund investments

## The Equity mutual fund subcategories

1. Large-cap fund: As the name suggests, a large-cap equity fund indicates that the fund invests predominantly in large-cap stocks. Large-cap stocks â€“ 1st to 100th company in terms of full market capitalization
   1. Usually, when an investor decides to invest in a large-cap fund, he has a twin agenda â€“ (a) capital appreciation in line with the markets, (b) low volatility. By low volatility here, means with respect to small and mid-cap funds.
   2. In simple words, this means that the investor is looking at wealth creation but with not so much risk to his capital.

2. Mid-cap/small cap: The mid-cap fund predominantly consists of mid-cap stocks and the small-cap funds contain small-cap companies. The volatility in mid and small-cap stocks is quite high. 
   1. Mid-cap stocks â€“ 101st to 250th company in terms of full market capitalization
   2. Small-cap stocks â€“ 250th company onwards in terms of full market capitalisation

Note - according to the given pictures, the ten-year performance of small and mid-cap funds are better than the large-cap funds; this should be evident to you because small and mid-cap funds are more volatile compared to large-cap funds.

3. large and mid-cap funds: The large and mid-cap fund is a cocktail of both mid and large-cap stocks. Unlike an exclusive large/mid/small-cap fund, the â€˜large & midâ€™ cap fund is expected to have 35% of its investment in large-cap and another 35% in mid-cap stocks

The risk is higher than a large-cap fund but lower compared to mid or small-cap fund.

performance in 10 years term - Over the last ten years, the returns range from 7.16% on the lower side to 18.22%  on the higher side. These returns should give you a sense of how the risk profile of the focused funds.
   
4. Multicap funds: The fund manager is free to pick stocks from the entire market and create a diversified portfolio (the diversification is mainly in terms of market capitalization). In a sense, the fund manager is chasing opportunities that he thinks make sense. The only mandate for a multi-cap fund is that it should consist of 65% investments in equity and related instruments.

performance in 10 yrs term - the returns average about 10 â€“ 11%, the lowest being 7.36% and higher is around 16%.

Important point - The AMC is an asset-gathering machine. It tries to attract more and more funds to its schemes. Imagine, a multi-cap fund does the asset gathering part very well and gathers a ton of assets. What do you think will happen to this fund?

Well, as the asset size grows, they will have to deploy this fund into stocks. Unfortunately, in the Indian stock markets, the liquidity in the small-cap space is not much, hence the fund is forced to invest the funds in large and mid-cap funds.

Hence, as the asset base grows, a Multi cap fund tends to work like a large and mid-cap fund.

good for beginners.

Note in general -> The common theory is that the higher the number of stocks, the lower is your risk (and of course the return).
```

5. Focused Funds: The focused funds, contains a maximum of 30 stocks in the portfolio, thereby creating a concentrated portfolio. A concentrated portfolio is a portfolio with few stocks (max 30 in this case), but each stock is picked only after rigorous due diligence

performance in 10 years term - Over the last ten years, the returns range from 7.25% on the lower side to 16.75%  on the higher side. These returns should give you a sense of how the risk profile of the focused funds.

Important Note - the focused fund is not for someone who is starting his or her mutual fund investment journey. Because the focused fund will be a lot more volatile compared to a diversified mutual fund.

6. Dividend yield funds: The strategy involves investing in companies that payout (high)` dividends regularly.

Dividend yield = Dividend paid during the year/ stock price

```
For example, if Infosys trading at Rs.780/- per share pays a dividend of Rs.22/- for the year, then Infosysâ€™s dividend yield is â€“

= 22/780

= 2.8%
```

the fund is predominantly invested i.e. at least 65% in dividend-yielding stocks and rest 35% in may be invested in non-dividend-yielding stocks

7.  ELSS Funds: The â€˜Equity-linked Savings Schemeâ€™ or the ELSS funds are a special category of mutual funds that enjoy tax exemption on investments made under section 80C of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1961.

Section 80C in the income tax act allows you to reduce your tax burden by accommodating for certain investments and payments made during the financial year, the reduction in the tax burden, however, is up to Rs.1,50,000/- per year.

For example, if you have a total gross yearly income of Rs.1,200,000/- then you can choose to invest Rs.1,50,000/- in various 80C options and reduce the tax burden. If you do so, your taxable income reduces to 1,050,000/-.

You can choose to invest either the entire permitted amount of Rs.1,50,000/- in ELSS or split this amount across many different schemes such as Life Insurance, Public Provident Fund, five year FD, Sukanya Smariddi Yojana, etc.

There are two important things to note here â€“

1. ELSS funds have a mandatory lock-in of 3 years. I guess this the Governmentâ€™s way of inculcating long term investing behavior ðŸ™‚
2. ELSS funds have a mandate to invest 80% of the funds in equity and equity-related instruments. There is no restriction on the market capitalization of stocks.

ELSS mutual fund, in general, can probably be considered as a proxy for a multi-cap fund.
